	In this ever changing world, full of shaved heads, dyed hair, perfect beards many are using their newly found free time to alter their appearances.

	Here in 2020 where many are spending more time home, with family or maybe alone. Many have come to a realization, either with themselves or about life, Maybe they had free time to truly think about what important. Hmm… something has changed, some of these changes might be permanent. Sticks-and-pokes the skin, with every incision there is pain, followed by fear, fear of what people might think. 
  who is that, that’s so weird, what a loser. These same comments never stop someone from dying their hair, changing their body, in fact it is these exact people who are successful in life, for the simple reason they take ricks.

	Specking of risks. According to physicians, there are medical risks associated with this kind of tattooing. “There’s really no safe way to do it at home,” said Dr. Arash Akhavan, a dermatologist in New York City. “There’s probably a 25 to 50 percent chance you’re going to have some sort of complication.”
Bacterial infections, like staph and MRSA, can occur if the tattoo equipment isn’t sterile. Viral infections like hepatitis and H.I.V. can pass through needles. “There’s a reason tattoos are a heavily regulated, monitored industry,” Dr. Akhavan said.
Still, whether driven by boredom or the closure of traditional tattoo shops, many are trying it. An at-home kit costs about $50. And for some, tattoos are a way to assert control, at least over one’s body.
